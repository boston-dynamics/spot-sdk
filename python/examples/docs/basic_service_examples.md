# Basic Service Examples

The following examples show how to use various Boston Dynamics API services and make the RPC calls to the service using the available client code. See the [networking documentation](../../../docs/concepts/networking.md) for more information on gRPC and how the different commands reach the robot, and the [base robot services](../../../docs/concepts/base_services.md) and [robot state services](../../../docs/concepts/robot_services.md) documents to learn about the specific services used in each example.
