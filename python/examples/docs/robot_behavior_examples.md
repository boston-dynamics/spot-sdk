# Robot Behavior and Commands Examples

The following examples show how to command the robot to complete different behaviors in different scenarios. See the [robot services](../../../docs/concepts/robot_services.md) document and the [geometry and frames](../../../docs/concepts/geometry_and_frames.md) document, which respectively cover the robot command service and the different frames of the robot which can be used to simplify behavior commands.
