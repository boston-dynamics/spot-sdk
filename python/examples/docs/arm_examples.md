# Arm Examples

The following examples show how to use the different arm API commands to control the arm and gripper while commanding the robot.

See the [robot services](../../../docs/concepts/robot_services.md) document and the [geometry and frames](../../../docs/concepts/geometry_and_frames.md) document, which respectively cover the robot command service and the different frames of the robot which can be used to simplify behavior commands.
