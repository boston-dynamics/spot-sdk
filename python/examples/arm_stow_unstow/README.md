# Arm Deploy and Stow

An example of commanding the arm to deploy to the ready position, and then stow. The example
initializes the SDK to talk to robot and then requests Spot to stand before executing the requests.

## Understanding Spot Programming

For your best learning experience, please use the [Quickstart Guide](../../../docs/python/quickstart.md)
found in the SDK's docs/python directory. That will help you get your Python programming environment set up properly.

## Common Problems

1. Remember, you will need to launch a software e-stop separately. The E-Stop programming example is [here](../estop/README.md).
2. Make sure the Motor Enable button on the Spot rear panel is depressed.
3. Make sure Spot is sitting upright, with the battery compartment on the side closest the floor.

## Setup Dependencies

This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Example

To run the example:

```
python3 arm_stow_unstow.py ROBOT_IP
```
