# Arm and Mobility Follow

This example moves the arm and requests the body to move to a good position based
on the arm's location.

## Understanding Spot Programming

For your best learning experience, please use the [Quickstart Guide](../../../docs/python/quickstart.md)
found in the SDK's docs/python directory. That will help you get your Python programming environment set up properly.

## Common Problems

1. Remember, you will need to launch a software e-stop separately. The E-Stop programming example is [here](../estop/README.md).
2. Make sure the Motor Enable button on the Spot rear panel is depressed.
3. Make sure Spot is sitting upright, with the battery compartment on the side closest the floor.

## Setup Dependencies

This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Example

Please be aware that this demo causes the robot to move its arm forward and the body will
walk behind the hand. Ensure you have enough clearance around the robot to run the example.

To run the example:

```
python3 arm_with_body_follow.py ROBOT_IP
```
