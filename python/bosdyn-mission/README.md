The bosdyn-mission wheel contains client interfaces and helper functionality for managing
missions, which are part of the Boston Dynamics Spot API. The client interfaces in this wheel
implement the mission-related Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) defined in
[bosdyn-api wheel](https://pypi.org/project/bosdyn-api/) and they utilize code included in the
[bosdyn-client wheel](https://pypi.org/project/bosdyn-client/). Full design documentation for the
functionality included in this wheel can be found
[here](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/autonomy/missions_service).
