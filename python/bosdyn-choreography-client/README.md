The bosdyn-choreography-client wheel contains client interfaces for interacting with the Boston Dynamics Choreography API. The client interfaces implement the choreography-related Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) defined in the [bosdyn-api wheel](https://pypi.org/project/bosdyn-api/). Full design documentation for the functionality included in this wheel can be found [here](../../../docs/concepts/choreography/readme.md)
