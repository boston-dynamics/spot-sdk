# Spot SDK

Develop applications and payloads for Spot using the Boston Dynamics Spot SDK.

The SDK consists of:

- [Conceptual documentation](docs/concepts/README.md). These documents explain the key abstractions used by the Spot API.
- [Python client library](docs/python/README.md). Applications using the Python library can control Spot and read sensor and health information from Spot. A wide variety of example programs and a QuickStart guide are also included.
- [Payload developer documentation](docs/payload/README.md). Payloads add additional sensing, communication, and control capabilities beyond what the base platform provides. The Payload ICD covers the mechanical, electrical, and software interfaces that Spot supports.
- [Spot API protocol definition](protos/bosdyn/api/README.md). This reference guide covers the details of the protocol applications used to communicate to Spot. Application developers who wish to use a language other than Python can implement clients that speak the protocol.
- [Spot SDK Repository](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk). The GitHub repo where all of the Spot SDK code is hosted.

This is version 5.0.1.2 of the SDK. Please review the [Release Notes](docs/release_notes.md) to see what has changed.
