# Python Library

The Python library is used by applications to control Spot, read sensor information, and register payload services.

## Using the Python Library

The [Python QuickStart](quickstart.md) is the recommended way to get started using the Python library. It is a step-by-step guide that will help you install the Python libraries you need and run simple programs to control Spot.

[Understanding Spot Programming](understanding_spot_programming.md) goes deeper than the QuickStart and covers some of the key concepts of developing applications for Spot.

The [Python example programs](../../python/examples/README.md) demonstrate how to use the Python library, and can be used as reference programs for your own applications.

The [Python reference guide](../../python/README.md) documents all of the Python modules, classes, and interfaces in detail.

### Supported Platforms and Versions

The Python client library is supported on the following platforms:
  * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  * Windows 10
  * MacOS 10.14 (Mojave and Catalina)

Python 3.6-3.10 are supported.

Python 2.7 is _not_ supported, since the [Python 2 End-Of-Life](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/) happened at the start of 2020.
