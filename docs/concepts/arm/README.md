# Spot Arm and Gripper

Arm and gripper commands are included as of the 2.3.0 release of the SDK. Direct control of the arm and gripper have been added to the synchronized command message, allowing operators to request any combination of mobility, arm, and gripper commands.  We have also added new services to support manipulation, door opening, and surface contact.  See the below sections for more details.
