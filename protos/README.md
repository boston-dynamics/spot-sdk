The bosdyn-api wheel contains the Python implementation for the Protobuf definitions in the Boston 
Dynamics Spot API. The message and service types defined in this wheel are used by the clients in 
[bosdyn-client](https://pypi.org/project/bosdyn-client/), 
[bosdyn-mission](https://pypi.org/project/bosdyn-mission/) and [bosdyn-choreography-client](https://pypi.org/project/bosdyn-choreography-client/) wheels to communicate with the services 
running on the Spot robots.
